- To run the web-app first clone the project using ```git clone https://github.com/ankit01ojha/PAB.git```.
- Install ```http-server`` using ``` npm install http-server -g```. And then run ```http-server``` in the cloned directory.
- Open ```localhost:8080``` in your browser and then you will see all the files in the directory( because there is no index file in the repo). So, click on any of these ```NorthInd.html```, ```Cakes.html``` or ```Snacks.html```. ANd then it will work as a normal web-app.
